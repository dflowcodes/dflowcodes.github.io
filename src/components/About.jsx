            Well, I am originally from Watervliet, a Michigan small town near
            the shores of Lake Michigan. My father moved to the city of Chicago
            when I was about ten, and from there onward I was more or less a
            dual resident. The vast differences in culture and technology
            between small towns and large cities was very apparent to me at a
            young age, and this is where my interest in tech and software
            ultimately began. I spent most of my high school years working at a
            wildly popular lakeshore restaurant,{" "}
            <a style={hl} href="https://silverbeachpizza.com/">
              Silver Beach Pizza.
            </a>{" "}
            I was captain of my varsity football team as a senior, as well as a
            member of the varisty track and basketball teams, and I am a{" "}

              Michigan Boys State

            alumni as well. In my scarce free time, I would try my best to teach
            myself programming in languages like python and C/C++. At a smaller
            high school I had very little exposure to computer science in the
            classroom, but I knew my calling was in the tech field.

          <p>
            In 2017, I graduated from Watervliet High School and began studying
            Electrical Engineering at the{" "}
            <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/" style={hl}>
              University of Michigan
            </a>{" "}
            in Ann Arbor. Here I quickly found my passion for the logic of
            programming and software and finally made the switch to computer
            science after taking discrete mathematics as a sophomore. I never
            looked back. In the classroom, I have studied a wide range of
            topics: data structures and algorithms, logic, computer security,
            cryptographic theory, web systems, computer architecture, assembly
            languages, database systems, mobile application design, and software
            engineering to name a few.

            As far as programming expertise goes, I have worked in or completed
            projects with the following languages/frameworks: C, C++, python,
            java, javascript, html/css, swift, golang, sql, and mongodb. I have
            worked with mapreduce frameworks like hadoop, flask backends, AWS,
            React, and more. Because I switched majors late in my sophomore
            year, my first internship in summer 2019 was actually in a position
            centered around electrical engineering through{" "}
            <a style={hl} href="http://www.aep.com/">
              AEP.
            </a>{" "}
            I didn't get much programming experience here outside of automating
            a few excel scripts, but I learned a lot about how to boost the
            productivity of a workplace and be a good teammate within a larger
            corporate setting where you do not have control over every aspect of
            a large operation.

            Fast forward to summer of 2020, I received my first offer to work as
            a software engineer for{" "}
            <a style={hl} href="https://www.factset.com/">
              FactSet.
            </a>{" "}
            Here, I got full control over my own independent project. I created
            a completely standalone application that helped automate a confusing
            task for users. Though I cannot divulge specifics as far as this
            project is concerned, I can say that I worked with both front and
            backend technologies on this project, creating a seamless UI that
            assisted internal users with everyday tasks. I enjoyed my time at
            FactSet, and apparently they did as well. As of today, I will
            graduate with a BSE in Computer Science in May 2021, and I will be
            returning to their Chicago office in July of 2021 to begin working
            as a full time developer.
