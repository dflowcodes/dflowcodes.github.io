In my scarce free time, I would try my best to teach\n            myself programming in languages like python and C/C++. At a smaller\n            high school I had very little exposure to computer science in the\n            classroom, but I knew my calling was in the tech field.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In 2017, I graduated from Watervliet High School and began studying\n            Electrical Engineering at the{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://cse.engin.umich.edu/\" style={hl}>\n              University of Michigan\n            </a>{\" \"}\n            in Ann Arbor. Here I quickly found my passion for the logic of\n            programming and software and finally made the switch to computer\n            science after taking discrete mathematics as a sophomore. I never\n            looked back. In the classroom, I have studied a wide range of\n            topics: data structures and algorithms, logic, computer security,\n            cryptographic theory, web systems, computer architecture, assembly\n            languages, database systems, mobile application design, and software\n            engineering to name a few.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As far as programming expertise goes, I have worked in or completed\n            projects with the following languages/frameworks: C, C++, python,\n            java, javascript, html/css, swift, golang, sql, and mongodb. I have\n            worked with mapreduce frameworks like hadoop, flask backends, AWS,\n            React, and more. Because I switched majors late in my sophomore\n            year, my first internship in summer 2019 was actually in a position\n            centered around electrical engineering through{\" \"}\n            <a style={hl} href=\"http://www.aep.com/\">\n              AEP.\n            </a>{\" \"}\n            I didn't get much programming experience here outside of automating\n            a few excel scripts, but I learned a lot about how to boost the\n            productivity of a workplace and be a good teammate within a larger\n            corporate setting where you do not have control over every aspect of\n            a large operation.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Fast forward to summer of 2020, I received my first offer to work as\n            a software engineer for{\" \"}\n            <a style={hl} href=\"https://www.factset.com/\">\n              FactSet.\n            </a>{\" \"}\n            Here, I got full control over my own independent project. I created\n            a completely standalone application that helped automate a confusing\n            task for users. Though I cannot divulge specifics as far as this\n            project is concerned, I can say that I worked with both front and\n            backend technologies on this project, creating a seamless UI that\n            assisted internal users with everyday tasks. I enjoyed my time at\n            FactSet, and apparently they did as well. As of today, I will\n            graduated with a BSE in Computer Science in May 2021, and I will be\n            returning to their Chicago office in July of 2021 to begin working\n            as a full time developer.\n          </p>\n          <p>To be continued....</p>\n          <span style={a}>devon@flowers</span>:<span style={b}>~ </span>\n          <span style={c}>$</span> exit\n          <p>[Process completed]</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default About;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
